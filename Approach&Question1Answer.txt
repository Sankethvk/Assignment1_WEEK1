Question 1:
Scenario Analysis 
FlyHigh Airlines were facing problems of modern feature scarcity such as no aircraft maintenance feature and e-ticket booking facility.
So, these features were added. The already existing bookTicket class which was private was used in e-ticket booking class, concept of 
inheritance was used.Also Luggage class was added where it automatically generates a statement whether the permitted luggage weight is appropriate
corresponding to appropriate flight class or else additional amount to be paid is displayed.Aircraft maintenance class provides brief information about
flight maintenance and also provides its parking spot ID and serviceman of that particular flight.So all these classes are used to generate a final ticket 
to the customer.

So features of c# used to reuse the existing application code is INHERITANCE. So, data members and member variables of the class bookticket was used
in e-ticket booking class.As the bookticket class had private variables , I have used concept of PROPERTY(getter,setter method) to access private variables.


Define an interface,benifits of using interface:
ANS : Interface is basically like an abstract class , as all the methods or functions declared in interface are abstract methods.Interface is public and abstract
by default. So ,  it cannot have method body and also cannot be instantiated.The main purpose of using interface is to acheive multiple inheritance which cannot 
be acheived by class.It's implementation must be provided through class or struct. The class or struct which implements the interface, must provide the implementation 
of all the methods declared inside the interface or else there will be an error.
